#Creates X and Y where both have a Verification on chain. Y also has one in the mempool.
#Also Z, descendant of X, which doesn't have a Verification on chain.
#Verifies:
#- When X is beaten, Y is also marked as beaten.
#- Y's pending Verification is dropped from the Block Template.
#- Z is pruned.
#- Neither X nor Y can have Transactions appended to their trees.
#- Y cannot have a Verification added via either a SignedVerification nor a Block.
