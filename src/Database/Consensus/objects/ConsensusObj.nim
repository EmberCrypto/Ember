Save back a Transaction's Status.
I honestly forget why this is needed.
Since we only commit to the database at the end of every block, and the table should be updated with refs...
We should be able to use those two properties and just save them all back at once on block addition.
My only two guesses are:
1) A transaction system. We making changes to a status and then discard them on error.
2) We only want to save back statuses that have been changed.
If I had to guess, I'd assume its the second.
That said, we should be able to use a HashSet and remove this boiler place.
