    Hello,

    I see you are trying to parse a Mint. Why? Let me guess!
        - Because we currently don't.
        - You want to know the format.
    Am I right? Let me explain why we don't, as to make clear how this not an oversight.

    We don't parse Mints because Mints should always be created by the local Node.
    By parsing a Block, you parse all the data needed for a Mint, and should create one yourself.
    If we parsed Mints, anyone could create coins, since we don't verify the reason for their creation.

    I'd like to thank you for the effort if you wanted to contribute.
    If you wanted to know the format for you own work, I'd like to thank you for expanding the ecosystem.

    Don't parse Mints.

    --Luke Parker
