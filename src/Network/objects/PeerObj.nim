Handshakes include service bytes, which are used to declare supported... services.
Right now, these are just used to say a peer is accepting connections as a server.
In the future, it can be used for protocol extensions which allow optimizations without a hardfork.
Or building a second layer communication network on top of the existing Meros network, through nodes who allow it.
