There are some unstated gotchas that we use throughout this file.

1. Sometimes a function requires that a given Merkle is
   necessarily a leaf or necessarily a branch. Since the
   Merkle type can be either, this allows for a possible
   runtime error. However, this is not possible though
   the exposed API and must only be accounted for
   internally.

2. The tree invariant: That
   (I) All leafs to the left of a non-nil leaf are non-nil,
   and all leafs to the right of a nil leaf are nil, and
   (II) All leaf nodes exist on the same depth.

   All the 'source' or 'argument' hashes of a Merkle tree, i.e.,
   the leaves, can be conceptualized as existing in a sequence.
   Thus consider the 'source' hashes A, B, C, and D:

       A B C D

   From this sequence we buld the Merkle tree

             ABCD
         AB       CD
       A    B   C    D

    And we see that all the leaves exist on the same
    depth, and thus the reason for (II).

    The reason for (I) becomes clear when we consider adding
    a leaf E. Adding it to the sequence looks like:

        A B C D E

    In order to create the Merkle tree for this, we build
    it up as we had before, but we'll be missing some elements.
    We'll fill those in with "?".

                   ABCDE???
             ABCD           E???
         AB       CD     E?      ?? 
       A    B   C    D E    ?  ?    ?

    In practice, these "?"s are represented by `nil`. So (I)
    then reads:

        All leafs to the left of a non-"?" leaf are non-"?",
        and all leafs to the right of a non-"?" leaf are "?".

    See that it holds for this example, and also when we add
    another node F:

                   ABCDEF??
             ABCD           EF??
         AB       CD     EF      ?? 
       A    B   C    D E    F  ?    ?

   And intuitively should keep holding forever.

   Now, how the "?"s are treated is actually slightly
   subtle. Essentially, when combining two trees,
   if the right tree is missing (since ONLY the right
   tree can, due to (I)), we treat it as a duplicate
   of the left tree. Thus if we denote "copies" with
   lowercase letters, then

         A?        is treated as        Aa
       A    ?                         A    a

   And the previous large tree is treated as:

                   ABCDEFef
             ABCD           EFef
         AB       CD     EF      ef 
       A    B   C    D E    F

   See that the bottom-rightmost two leaves are disregarded
   entirely, since we can get the value of their parent, ef,
   from its sibling, EF.
