### Ember Whitepaper: Being  Written

#### Current State
Ember is still under development and is running a Developer Testnet. Anyone can participate if they compile their own Node.

#### Compiling

For guides on how to compile Ember, please see https://github.com/EmberCrypto/Ember/tree/master/docs/Compilation.

#### Contributing

Ember will not have an ICO, yet the community voted on whether or not there should be a premine. The community decided there should be a seven week premine (Ember doesn't have a max supply, and therefore the premine amount cannot be denominated via a percent). Two weeks will be released at the launch of the network, with one more week released every six months. This will allow a strong mainnet launch, guaranteeing Ember's success, and funding for three years.
