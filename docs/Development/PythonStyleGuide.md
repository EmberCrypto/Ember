# Python Style Guide

1. Be concise, but never implicit.
2. Use a 2-space ident.

3. For variables/class attributes, use camelCase for naming.
4. For classes/enum attributes, use PascalCase.
5. Use type hints for everything.

6. Every function definition should place each argument on their own line.
7. When splitting data over multiple lines (function call, tuple, array...), place each value on their own line.
8. Don't split data over multiple lines unless the line goes over 80 characters.
9. Comment your code as needed. It is better to comment too much than too little.

10. Pass PyLint.
