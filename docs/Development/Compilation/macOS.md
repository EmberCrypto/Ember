### Prerequisites

- Homebrew
- Git
- GCC/G++:
- Make
- CMake _(for BLS)_
- autoconf / automake / libtool _(for Minisketch)_
- Python 3.6 and Pip _(for the tests)_
- choosenim
- Nim 1.2.4

To install every prerequisite, run:

```
xcode-select --install
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install git cmake autoconf automake libtool python
curl https://nim-lang.org/choosenim/init.sh -sSf | sh
choosenim 1.2.4
```

You will have to update your path, as according to choosenim, before running any Nim-related commands.

### Meros

#### Build

```
git clone https://github.com/MerosCrypto/Meros.git
cd Meros
nimble build

> There's also a headless version which doesn't import any GUI files available via adding `-d:nogui` to the build command.
