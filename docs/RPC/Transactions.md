# Transactions Module

### `getTransaction`

`getTransaction` replies with the requested Transaction.

Arguments:
- `hash` (string)

The result is an object, as follows:
- `descendant` (string)

- `inputs` (array of objects, each as follows)
  - `hash` (string)

  	When (`descendant` == "Claim") or (`descendant` == "Send"):
    - `nonce` (int)

- `outputs` (array of objects, each as follows)
  - `amount` (string)

    When `descendant` == "Mint":
    - `nick` (int): Miner nickname.

    When `descendant` == "Claim" or `descendant` == "Send":
    - `key` (string): Ed25519 Public Key.

- `hash` (string)

	When `descendant` == "Claim":
  - `signature` (string)

	When `descendant` == "Send":
  - `signature` (string)
  - `proof`     (int)
  - `argon`     (string)

	When `descendant` == "Data":
  - `data`      (string)
  - `signature` (string)
  - `proof`     (int)
  - `argon`     (string)

### `getUTXOs`

`getUTXOs` replies with an address's UTXOs (which are marked confirmed by the node and have no existing spenders).

Arguments:
- `address` (string)

The result is an array of objects, each as follows:
- `hash`  (string)
- `nonce` (int)

### `getBalance`

`getBalance` replies with the balance of the specified address, defined as the sum of the value of its UTXOs (using the same rules as above for which are considered).

Arguments:
- `address` (string)

The result is a string of the balance.

### `publishTransaction`

`publishTransaction` accepts a serialized Transaction, attempts to add it to the local Transactions DAG, and on success, broadcasts it to the network.

Arguments:
- `type`        (string): "Claim", "Send", or "Data".
- `transaction` (string): Serialized Transaction.

The result is a bool of if the transaction was successfully added. This will return true if the transaction is valid yet already exists, though it will NOT be broadcasted again in that case.

### `publishTransactionWithoutWork`

`publishTransactionWithoutWork` accepts a serialized Transaction, without work, generates work for it against the current difficulty, and then attempts to add it to the local Transactions DAG. Upon success, it's broadcasted to the network. This method requires authentication.

The inputs and outputs of this function match `publishTransaction` exactly.
